# dotfiles
A collection of files and scripts that I use, and that may be of some help or interest to others.

The scripts folder has some things that may be useful for some:

- `colours.sh` which isn't my code; it shows the assigned terminal colorus
- `perform` [Bash] sets the CPU performance preference and scaling governor to maximum performance (I use it when I'm using a virtual machine)
- `xdgs` [Bash] gives easier (user) control over the `xdg-screensaver` program
